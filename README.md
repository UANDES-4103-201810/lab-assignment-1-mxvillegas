3) Elements
This code has two significant sections: the head and the body.
- In the head, first we describe the data information using <meta> tag. Then we associate using <link> tag. And finally we define the title of the head using <title> tag.
- In the body, first, it is the <center> tag to align the tex. Then we have a table, which has some attributes like id, width, cellpadding, etc.
But inside the table, we can also describe the "table row" as <tr>, the "table header" as <th> and the "table data cell" as <td>. In this case we only have <tr> and <td> description. Finally we have a <script> tag, with a source attribute of javascript.

4) Sources
Here we have 4 types of documents. 
- First we have the HTML file, where is the structure of the page. 
- Then we have a javascript (js) file, where are all the functions that we use to make the page work.
- Then we have a css file. Here we "make the page pretty". It describe the HTML document, and how the elements are going to be dispay.
- Finally we have some documents with icons that are used in the web page.

5) The files were loaded at different instant of time, but they are all needed to show the web page. xhr allow the browser request and send data from and to the web server without reloading the page.
